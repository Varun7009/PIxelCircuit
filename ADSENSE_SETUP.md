# How to Get Real Ads on Your Website

## Steps to Enable Real Google AdSense Ads

### 1. Apply for Google AdSense
- Go to https://www.google.com/adsense/
- Sign up with your Google account
- Add your website URL (your Replit project URL)
- Wait for approval (can take 1-14 days)

### 2. Get Your Publisher ID
Once approved, Google will give you:
- Publisher ID (looks like: ca-pub-1234567890123456)
- Ad unit codes for different ad sizes

### 3. Replace Demo Ads
Currently your site shows demo ads with gradients. To show real ads:

**Find this in your code:**
```html
<!-- Demo Advertisement - Replace with real AdSense when approved -->
<div class="demo-ad" style="background: linear-gradient(...)">
```

**Replace with:**
```html
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-7350438200387137"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<!-- PixelCircuit -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7350438200387137"
     data-ad-slot="3986949028"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
```

### 4. Why You Can't See Real Ads Yet
- Your site currently uses demo publisher ID: ca-pub-1234567890123456
- This is a fake ID that shows demo ads only
- Real ads need approval from Google first

### 5. What Happens After Approval
- Google will review your content
- If approved, they'll provide real publisher ID
- Real ads will start showing automatically
- You'll earn money from ad clicks and views

## Current Status
✅ Ad structure is ready and properly coded

## Next Steps
1. Apply for Google AdSense approval
2. Wait for approval email
3. Get your real publisher ID
4. Replace the demo IDs in the code
5. Real ads will start showing!
