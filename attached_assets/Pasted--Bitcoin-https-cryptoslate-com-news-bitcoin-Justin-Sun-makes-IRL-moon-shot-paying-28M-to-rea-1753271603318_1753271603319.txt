Justin Sun makes IRL moon shot, paying $28M to reach space aboard Blue Origin’s next mission
While awaiting a settlement with the SEC, Sun sets sights on space with his long-awaited Blue Origin ticket.
Tron founder [Justin Sun](https://cryptoslate.com/people/justin-sun/) is finally heading to space, nearly four years after spending $28 million for a seat aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard.
On July 21, Sun [confirmed](https://x.com/justinsuntron/status/1947308659266187675) he would be among six passengers on the company’s upcoming NS-34 mission. This mission will mark Blue Origin’s 34th flight and 14th human-crewed launch.
Real estate investor Arvi Bahal, Turkish entrepreneur Gökhan Erdem, Puerto Rican meteorologist Deborah Martorell, orphanage director Lionel Pitchford, and serial entrepreneur J.D. Russell will join Sun on the suborbital journey.
Blue Origin has not yet announced the exact flight date, but says a live webcast will begin 30 minutes before liftoff.
Sun, who previously missed the inaugural launch he bid for in 2021, [described](https://x.com/justinsuntron/status/1947311516593668331) himself playfully as “the youngest Chinese commercial astronaut.”
Although he didn’t fly at the time, his $28 million contribution was donated to Blue Origin’s foundation, Club for the Future.
The funds were distributed among 19 space-focused non-profits, with each organization receiving $1 million to promote youth engagement in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM).
Since its first crewed mission, Blue Origin has flown 70 people beyond the Kármán line—the widely recognized edge of outer space.
Justin Sun’s fame
Sun remains one of the most polarizing [personalities in the crypto industry](https://cryptoslate.com/trons-justin-sun-plans-to-public-in-us-with-eric-trump-through-210m-srm-reverse-merger-deal/) and is known for his bold stunts and headline-grabbing investments.
Last year, he was revealed as a [key investor in World Liberty Financial](https://cryptoslate.com/justin-suns-tron-network-invests-30-million-in-trump-family-backed-world-liberty-financial/), a crypto project tied to US President Donald Trump. He also held the [largest position in the TRUMP meme token](https://cryptoslate.com/tron-founder-justin-sun-tops-trump-memecoin-holders-earns-gala-dinner-invite-this-week/) and attended a private [dinner with the US president](https://cryptoslate.com/trump-gala-dinner-attendees-dump-tokens-after-event-as-price-falls-8-amid-protests/).
Meanwhile, his role in blockchain development has also attracted some regulatory scrutiny over the years.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged him with allegedly offering unregistered securities through the Tron project. However, the case has since [been paused](https://cryptoslate.com/tron-founder-justin-sun-and-sec-seek-time-out-for-potential-resolution/) while both parties consider a potential settlement.
Additionally, Sun also remains known for several headline-grabbing stunts.
In 2024, he [purchased](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/justin-sun-gave-silk-road-founder-ross-ulbricht-cattelan-banana-2651374) Maurizio Cattelan’s viral artwork “Comedian” (a banana duct-taped to a wall) for $6.2 million at Sotheby’s New York. He later ate the banana.
