Your site is already prepared for ads with:

## Next Steps
1. **Apply to Media.net first** (closest to Google AdSense)

## Content Filtering Applied
I've added filtering to avoid these topics:
- War and military content
- Political content
- Controversial topics
- Violence-related content

This should help with ad network approvals!
